# Testcase Example:  '"abccccdd"'
#
# Given a string which consists of lowercase or uppercase letters, find the
# length of the longest palindromes that can be built with those letters.
# 
# This is case sensitive, for example "Aa" is not considered a palindrome
# here.
# 
# Note:
# Assume the length of given string will not exceed 1,010.
# 
# 
# Example: 
# 
# Input:
# "abccccdd"
# 
# Output:
# 7
# 
# Explanation:
# One longest palindrome that can be built is "dccaccd", whose length is 7.

class Solution:
    def longestPalindrome(self, s: str) -> int:
        d = {}
        for c in s:
            d[c] = d.get(c, 0) + 1 
        l = d.values()
        e = len([i for i in l if i % 2 == 1])
        return sum(l) - e + (e > 0)
